An API is a set of interfaces that can be accessed by other users or developers.
To document such APIs, API specifications are used~\cite{de_api_2017}.
These specifications document the functioning and expected output of such interfaces.
The OpenAPI Standard~\cite{swagger_openapi_2021} is a specification language
that offers a standardized way of writing API specifications for HTTP-based APIs.
