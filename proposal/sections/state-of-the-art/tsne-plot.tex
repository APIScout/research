A t-SNE plot is an algorithm used to visualize high-dimensional data in a two- or three-dimensional space~\cite{maaten_visualizing_2008}.
This algorithm is a variation of the Stochastic Neighbor Embedding~\cite{hinton_stochastic_2002} approach presented in 2002.
The t-SNE variation, according to the authors, is \("\)much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map.\("\) \\ \\
With respect to the context of this proposal, the t-SNE plot is used to evaluate the output of the implemented information retrieval system~\cite{peltonen_information_2015}.
In our case, after retrieving the most similar documents to the query given in the ground truth, we plot these documents.
By using t-SNE, we can show the semantic distance between the documents and the relative queries (Subsection ~\ref{subsec:results}).
