After validating our system against a tailored ground truth, we compared the results of API Scout with the ones of APIs.guru.
The comparison was performed by taking the queries from the ground truth from Subsection~\ref{subsec:ground-truth} and searching for them on the APIs.guru website.
The result of this evaluation is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:apis-guru-eval}.
APIs.guru's platform has an average precision ($\overline{P}$) of 0, and a recall ($R$) of 0.
