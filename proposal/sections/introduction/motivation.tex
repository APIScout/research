From our research, we noticed that there is a void in tools and services that can be helpful in the study of the evolution and current state of HTTP APIs.
Although platforms such as SwaggerHub\footnote{https://app.swaggerhub.com/search} and APIs.guru\footnote{https://apis.guru/} already exist, they lack features that are essential for research. \\ \\
For example, they lack a proper search system.
In the previously mentioned platforms, indexing of specifications is superficial and most of the time only the title is matched with the query.
With API Scout, we want to index API specifications based not only on their title, but based on all the tags containing natural language. \\ \\
Another feature missing in the aforementioned platforms is a proper visualization system.
By using tools to convert specifications into interactive trees, users can better understand the structure of the service's endpoints.
Moreover, we can also plot some statistics about the selected API and how it compares to all the specifications present on our platform.
