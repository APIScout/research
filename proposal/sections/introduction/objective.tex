The goal of this thesis is to build a platform that both academics and developers can use to understand and study the intricacies of real-world HTTP APIs. \\ \\
In the case of the developers, they can search and consult our historical and current collection of APIs to better understand how to structure one.
Aided by the graphical tools, a developer can also understand how the endpoints should be structured to obtain a more cohesive structure. \\ \\
On the academic side, this tool can be used to perform research on the evolution of HTTP APIs in time.
By offering historical data as well as current data, researchers can have a better understanding of how endpoints and data structures change over time as a service grows in complexity.
Researchers can also use plots and statistics pre-computed by our platform to understand how an API specification relates to the plethora of specifications present.
